# Endpoint Domains

_What are server endpoint domains and how to use them?_

## What is a domain?

An Internet domain is a unique name that identifies a server or a website.

## Free Public Domains

Connect automatically provides a free public domain for every server that uses a [Connector](/guide/connectors/).
Players use your domain to directly join your server and bypass the [Browser Hub](/guide/advertising#browser-hub) at `minekube.net`.

## Joining your Server

For more information on how to join your server see [Joining your Server](includes/joining.md).

Sometimes you want to use your own domain for your server to let player join with.
This is great to build trust and a brand around your server and to make it easier for players to remember.
