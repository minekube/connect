## What is a Connector?

A Connector at Minekube Connect is a software component that facilitates the secure
communication between your Minecraft server/proxy and the Connect Edge Network by
creating secure outbound tunnels for receiving player connections.

## Available Connectors

**[Gate Connector](gate.md):** <VPBadge type="info">Recommended</VPBadge>

- Enable `connect` mode in the configuration to use it as a Connector for your
  server. Gate is updated most frequently and has the most capabilities.
- If you have an existing Java proxy, switch to [Gate Lite mode](gate.md#gate-lite-mode) to use it as a Connector
  without installing the Connect Java Plugin.

**[Java Plugin](plugin.md):** <VPBadge type="info">Fast set-up</VPBadge>

- The Spigot/Velocity/Bungee Connect Plugin can be installed on your Minecraft server/proxy to
  use it as a Connector for your endpoints.

## Advantages using a Connector

- You want to protect and hide your public IP address from attackers? Use a Connector.
- You don't have a public IP address, like running your server on a private network or at home? Use a Connector.

### Anycast Public IP

In any case, Connect gives your endpoints a shared public Anycast IP address reachable from
anywhere to route your player traffic through the nearest Connect Edge region to your Minecraft server.

## How does a Connector work?

The operation of a Connector can be simplified into three steps:

1. **Receiving the Player Session Proposal**: The Connector starts its operation when it receives a player session
   proposal from the Edge.

2. **Establishing the Outbound Tunnel Connection**: Upon receiving the session proposal, the Connector establishes an
   outbound tunnel connection back to the Edge.

3. **Forwarding the Player's Connection**: This outbound tunnel connection is then used by the Connector to forward the
   player's connection to the Minecraft server.
