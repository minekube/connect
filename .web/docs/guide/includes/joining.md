## Joining your Server

Every server has a unique configurable [Endpoint](/guide/#connect-endpoints) name that directly reflects
the domain players can join the server with.
If you leave this field empty, Connect will use a temporary random endpoint name
for your server provided by the [Random Name Service](https://randomname.minekube.net/).

You can always update that endpoint name in the config:

::: code-group
```yaml [plugins/connect/config.yml]
endpoint: your-server-name
```

```yaml [Gate config.yml]
connect:
  name: your-server-name
```
:::

> The environment variable `CONNECT_ENDPOINT` takes precedence over the configuration file.

### Joining with free provided Public Domain

After installing Connect plugin and starting your server
you will see the [free public domain](/guide/domains) for your server that looks like
`<endpoint>.play.minekube.net`.

::: code-group
```shell [Server Console]
[connect] Enabling connect vX.Y.Z
[connect] Enpoint name: live-beru
[connect] Your public address: live-beru.play.minekube.net
```
:::

Use your domain to join your server.

Ping requests are also mirrored to the endpoint server.


### Joining from Browser Hub

Players can also discover your server from the in-game
[Browser Hub](/guide/advertising#browser-hub) at `minekube.net`
and can join with the in-game UIs or with the `/browser join <your-server-name>` command.
