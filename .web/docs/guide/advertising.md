# Advertising Channels for Your Server <VPBadge type='danger'>Not yet available</VPBadge>

_Discovering and advertising your server is an important part of growing your community.
The [Connect Network](/guide/#the-connect-network) provides ways to advertise your servers to players._

## Browser Hub
<VPBadge>Always Free</VPBadge>

The well-known **Connect Browser Hub** is part of the [Connect Browser](/guide/#the-connect-browser) and is
one of the first places that players see when joining the [Connect Network](/guide/#the-connect-network)
without an [Endpoint Domain](/guide/domains).

It is a central place of the [Connect Platform](/guide/#the-connect-platform) that allows players to discover and join
[Connect Endpoints](/guide/#connect-endpoints) from in-game. Players also fallback to the
**Browser Hub** when they get disconnected from a server or try to join an endpoint that is currently inactive.

High above the clouds, the player seeks,
A new server to join, with Connect at its peaks.
```
