## Packaging Components

A game package for Minekube Games typically includes the following components:

- **Compiled Game Code**: This is the core of your game, written in your chosen programming language. It includes all the logic, mechanics, and assets that make up your game.
- **Configuration Files**: These files are used to configure the game's settings and behavior. They can include settings for the game itself, as well as for any dependencies or services your game uses.
- **Documentation**: This includes any marketing content, instructions or information needed to install, run, and play your game. It can also include information about the game's development and any known issues or limitations. By default, when launching and updating your game on the Minekube Browser your `README.md` file will be used as the game's description landing page.
- **License and Credits**: These files detail the legal information about your game, such as its license and any credits for assets or code used in the game. To protect your game's code further, you can use obfuscation tools to make it harder for others to reverse-engineer your source code.

## Benefits of Packaging

Packaging your game for distribution on Minekube Games has several benefits:

- **Quality Assurance**: By packaging your game, you can ensure that all necessary components are included and that the game functions as expected. This helps to prevent issues and bugs that could arise from missing or incompatible components.

## Preparing Your Game for Distribution

To prepare your game for distribution on Minekube Games, we simplified the series of steps for you. We provide Dockerfile examples and reusable GitHub Action templates to streamline the packaging and publishing process to Minekube. Here's how you can use these resources:

1. **Dockerize Your Game**: Docker is a platform that allows you to package your game into a container, making it easy to distribute and run on any system that supports Docker. We provide Dockerfile examples that you can use as a starting point for creating your own Dockerfile. This file will define how to build a Docker image of your game, including all the necessary components and dependencies.

2. **Set Up GitHub Actions**: GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform that allows you to automate your software workflows, including building, testing, and deploying your game. We provide reusable templates for GitHub Actions that you can use to automate the packaging and publishing of your game on Minekube Games. These templates include steps for building a Docker image of your game, pushing it to a Docker registry, and releasing it to Minekube Games.

3. **Test Your Game**: Before distributing your game, you should thoroughly test it to ensure that it works as expected. This includes testing the Docker image of your game to ensure that it runs correctly on different systems and configurations. You can first release your game on a test environment to ensure that it works as expected before publishing it to the public.

4. **Publish Your Game**: Once your game is packaged and tested, it gets automatically publish on Minekube Games.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your game is properly packaged and ready for distribution on Minekube Games. This will make it easier for players to install and play your game, and will help to ensure a smooth and enjoyable gaming experience.
